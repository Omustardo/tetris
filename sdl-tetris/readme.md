Golang demo to show use of basic SDL.

 

You’ll need to install SDL:

https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2

 

and then this repo:

`go get -u github.com/omustardo/tetris/sdl-tetris`

 

run tetris with:

`go run github.com/omustardo/tetris/sdl-tetris/main.go`

 

I didn’t make any endgame conditions or tracking of score, but the gameplay
works.
